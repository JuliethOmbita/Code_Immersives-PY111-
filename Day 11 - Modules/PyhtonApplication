        Python Applications - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

There is a unprecedented demand of innovation in Biotech, in other words: systematic storage of massive research data, analysis of humongous databases, and meticulous management of the business processes; AI applications play a crucial role in meeting these demands. Additionally, Machine learning, robotics and informatics can help in expanding the horizons of the biotechnology industry and move towards newer possibilities.

The most popular python libraries are:

    ● SciPy for scientific and technical computing
    ● Pandas for data analysis and manipulation
    ● Keras for Artificial Neural Networks
    ● TensorFlow for Machine Learning tasks, especially Deep Neural Networks 
	○ NumPy for complex mathematical functions and computation
    ● Scikit-Learn for working with various Machine Learning models 

I want to part of the Biotechnology industry, working in the filtration, analysis, and the exchange of data in health organizations worldwide. More in detail, I want to work in drug manufacturing, chemical analysis of different compounds, and sequencing of RNA and DNA.
