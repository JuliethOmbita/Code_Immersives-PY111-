Convert Decimal Number to its equivalent Binary Number format.
#For converting numbers 0 - 255

Start
Step 1: Write down the decimal number
Step 2: Divide it by 2, write down the result and write aside the remainder.
Step 3: Repeat the step 2 but this time the divisor is the result.  
Step 4: If the new result is different than 0, then go back to the step 3. On the contrary, continue with the next step. 
Step 5: Write the remainder values from the last (Most Significant Bit - MSB) until the top value or first remainder (Least Significant Bit - LSB)
You have found the binary number of your decimal
